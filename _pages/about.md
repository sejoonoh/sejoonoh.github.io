* I am a 5th-year CS Ph.D. Candidate advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://github.com/sejoonoh/sejoonoh.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_Sejoon_Oh_Latest.pdf).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Seoul National University](http://snu.ac.kr) (Advisor: [Prof. U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/)), and I was a research intern in [SNU Data Mining LAB](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/).
* My research interests include adversarial machine learning, recommender system, natural language processing, and data mining & parallel computing.
* I enjoy **playing tennis, working out, video gaming, and traveling** in my free time!  

# What's New?

* (Aug. 2023) Two papers **[FINEST](https://github.com/sejoonoh/sejoonoh.github.io/blob/master/files/FINEST_FAccTRec_2023.pdf)** and **[HierSRec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06533)** are accepted to **RecSys 2023 [FAccTRec Workshop](https://facctrec.github.io/facctrec2023/) and [ORSUM Workshop](https://orsum.inesctec.pt/orsum2023/index.php)**! **FINEST** improves the robustness of existing recommenders against input perturbations, and **HierSRec** introduces hierarchical multi-task learning for session-based recommendations.
 
* (Aug. 2023) I finished my ML research internship in **[Netflix](https://research.netflix.com/)**! We built a multi-task learning model that can predict user intent and use the intent to enhance the next-item prediction. Many thanks to my mentors: **[Dr. Moumita Bhattacharya](https://sites.google.com/udel.edu/moumitabhattacharya)** and **[Dr. Yesu Feng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yesufeng/)**:)

* (May. 2023) I passed the thesis proposal defense and am a **PhD candidate** now! Just one more year to go!
