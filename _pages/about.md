* I am a **GenAI/ML Research Scientist @ [Netflix](https://research.netflix.com/)** working on **Foundation Models** at Netflix.
* I received my CS Ph.D. in **[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)**, advised by **[Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/)**.
* My research interests include **Generative AI, Multimodal LLMs, Recommender Systems, and Adversarial ML**.
* I enjoy **playing tennis, working out, video gaming, and traveling** in my free time!  

# What's New?

* (Jan. 2025) My **EB-1B (Outstanding Professors and Researchers)** green card application has been approved! Excited to develop my career in the US for a long time :)
* (Dec. 2024) Our **[UniGuard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01703)** paper is accepted to **[DAI 2025 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/dai-2025/home)** at **AAAI**. **UniGuard** is a novel multimodal safety guardrail that ensure safe LLM responses against adversarial prompts.
* (Sept. 2024) An intent-aware RecSys paper **[IntentRec](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.05353)** is accepted to **[BayLearn - Machine Learning Symposium 2024](https://baylearn-org.github.io/www/index.html)**! **IntentRec** improves next-item recommendations by finding a user session intent with hierarchical multi-task learning!

* (Aug. 2024) A adversarial defense paper **[FINEST](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3695256)** is accepted to **[TKDD Journal](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tkdd)**! We enhance the stability of existing sequential recommender systems via a special fine-tuning method called **FINEST**!

* (July. 2024) A adversarial ML + RecSys paper **[ATR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00312)** is accepted to **[CIKM 2024](https://cikm2024.org/)**. We investigate the robustness of SOTA text-aware recommender systems against our proposed text rewriting attack **ATR**.
