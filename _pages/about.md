* I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Srijan Kumar](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://github.com/sejoonoh/sejoonoh.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_Sejoon_Oh_Latest.pdf).
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Seoul National University](http://snu.ac.kr) (Advisor: [Prof. U Kang](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/~ukang/)), and I was a research intern in [SNU Data Mining LAB](https://datalab.snu.ac.kr/) for 2 years.
* My research interests include adversarial machine learning, recommender system, natural language processing, and data mining & parallel computing.


# What's New?

* (Jul. 2022) A paper '**M2TRec: Metadata-aware Multi-task Transformer for Large-scale and Cold-start free Session-based Recommendations**' is accepted to **RecSys 2022 LBR**! Our paper is a novel large-scale and cold-start free session-based recommenation framework.

* (May. 2022) We filed a **provisional patent** including our collaboration project with [**The Home Depot**](https://www.homedepot.com/). Our project develops a novel hierarchical multi-task learning framework for session-based recommendations.

* (Aug. 2021) A paper '[**Influence-guided Data Augmentation for Neural Tensor Completion**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10248)' is accepted to **CIKM 2021**! Our paper is a novel data augmentation framework for enhancing neural tensor completion.

* (May. 2021) I started my summer **Data Science Research Intern** position at [**The Home Depot**](https://www.homedepot.com/) under guidance of Dr. Xiquan Cui & Dr. Amin Javari & Rebecca West! I am developing a session-based personalized recommendation model using the HD dataset.

* (May. 2021) I was selected one of [**2021 ML@GT Fellow**](https://mlatgt.blog/2021/05/10/the-machine-learning-center-awards-inaugural-mlgt-fellows/), which supports 50% of the RA salary to help support my academic research.

* (Jan. 2021) I was selected one of **Finalists** of [**2021 Twitch Research Fellowship**](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/01/07/introducing-our-2021-twitch-research-fellows/), which grants $5K award to help support my academic research.
